## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

* This project is part of a Kaggle competition sponsored by Break Through Tech and the Algorithmic Justice League, aiming to build more inclusive AI models in dermatology. The competition involves Break Through Tech AI Fellows from various programs, including Virtual, MIT, and UCLA, with mentorship from data science and AI TAs.
* The primary goal of this competition is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying 21 different skin conditions across diverse skin tones. Given the historical underrepresentation of darker skin tones in dermatology AI datasets, this project seeks to address bias and improve model performance across all demographics. The competition evaluates submissions based on a weighted average F1 score.
* AI-driven diagnostic tools are increasingly used in healthcare, yet biases in training data can lead to disparities in diagnosis and treatment. By developing an inclusive dermatology AI model, this project contributes to reducing healthcare inequities, ensuring better diagnostic accuracy for historically marginalized communities. Our work aligns with ongoing research at institutions such as Stanford and MIT Media Lab, promoting fairness and explainability in AI models.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

**Dataset description**

* The competition dataset consists of dermatological images labeled with 21 different skin conditions. It includes metadata such as skin tone distribution and lesion types. To enhance model performance and fairness, we may incorporate external datasets and employ augmentation techniques.

**Data Exploration & Preprocessing Approaches**
- **Handling Class Imbalance:** Given the known imbalance in skin tone representation, we utilize data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and brightness adjustments to ensure fair representation across all skin tones.
- **Transfer Learning:** We fine-tune pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adapt them to our classification task, optimizing performance while reducing computational costs.
- **Fairness and Explainability:** Using AI fairness tools like Fairlearn, we analyze model biases and adjust our preprocessing pipeline accordingly.

**Challenges**

##### Class Imbalance  
- The dataset has an uneven distribution of skin tones, with lighter skin tones being overrepresented.  
- Certain skin conditions appear less frequently, making it difficult for the model to learn their patterns effectively.  

##### Variability in Image Quality  
- Images vary in resolution, lighting, and focus, which can affect model performance.  
- Some images may have noise that obscure skin conditions.  

##### Bias and Fairness Concerns  
- Existing dermatology AI models have historically struggled with darker skin tones due to biased training data.  
- Need to ensure that the model performs equitably across all demographic groups.
